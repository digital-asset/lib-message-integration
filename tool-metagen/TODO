# TODO

- XSD support is lacking some basic functionality not used in FpML and FIXML, e.g.
      - namespace support, e.g. xmlsig
- generated DAML files are two big, how can we split them up? Does DAML need forward-declarations / bootstrap modules?
- don't hard code "deriving (Eq, Ord, Show)", allow user to parse in class names to derive
